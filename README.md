# README for DataCamp Practice Script

## Overview

This README document provides comprehensive instructions and information about a Python script designed to automate interactions on a DataCamp practice page. The script is built using Selenium with the help of `undetected_chromedriver` to avoid detection mechanisms, allowing for automated keyboard inputs on the practice page.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- `undetected_chromedriver` package
- Google Chrome Browser
- ChromeDriver

### Installation

1. **Python 3.x**: If not already installed, download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/). Ensure you add Python to your system's PATH.

2. **Selenium**: Install Selenium using pip (Python's package installer). Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

`pip install selenium`

3. **`undetected_chromedriver`**: This package is used to bypass bot detection mechanisms in Selenium. Install it using pip:

`pip install undetected-chromedriver`

4. **Google Chrome Browser**: Ensure you have the latest version of Google Chrome installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

5. **ChromeDriver**: Download ChromeDriver from the [ChromeDriver downloads page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). Ensure the version of ChromeDriver matches your Google Chrome browser version. Extract the downloaded file and note its location.

## Configuration

1. **Script Configuration**: The script prompts you for your DataCamp email and password. Your password will be securely input without being displayed on the screen. 

2. **Google Chrome Binary Location**: The script will also prompt for the Google Chrome binary location. The default value is `"/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable"`. If your Google Chrome is located elsewhere, please provide the correct path when prompted.

## Usage

1. **Running the Script**: Navigate to the script's directory in your terminal or command prompt. Run the script using Python:

`python datacamp_xp_farm.py`

2. **Follow Prompts**: Enter your DataCamp email when prompted. Use the `getpass` prompt to securely enter your password. If necessary, enter the custom path to your Google Chrome binary or press Enter to use the default.

3. **Script Execution**: After inputting the necessary information, the script will automatically navigate to the specified DataCamp practice page, log in with your credentials, and begin the automated interaction sequence.

## Stopping the Script

To stop the script, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or command prompt. The script is designed to handle this interrupt gracefully and will terminate its execution.

## Troubleshooting

- **ChromeDriver Compatibility**: If you encounter issues related to ChromeDriver, ensure that the version of ChromeDriver matches your installed version of Google Chrome.
- **Selenium Errors**: Ensure you have the latest version of Selenium and `undetected_chromedriver`. Update them using pip if necessary.
- **Login Issues**: Verify your DataCamp credentials by logging in manually on the DataCamp website. Ensure there are no active CAPTCHAs or additional verification steps that might interfere with automated login.

## Advanced Usage

Advanced users can modify the script to customize the automation sequence, adjust waiting times, or handle additional elements on the practice page.

## Support

For support or questions, consider consulting Selenium documentation, `undetected_chromedriver` GitHub issues, or the DataCamp community forums.
